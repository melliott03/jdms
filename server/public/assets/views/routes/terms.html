<br>
In order to receive payment, Contractors must provide to NowLanguage their legal name, legal entity type, tax identification number (e.g., social security number or employer identification number), date of birth or date of formation, physical address, country, bank account number, and bank routing number.&nbsp; Each Contractor agrees that payments made by Companies shall be considered the same as a payment made directly to such Contractor. Contractors can receive payment by ACH to their Designated Bank Account.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<em data-new-link="true">Limited Payment Agency Terms</em><br><br>
Once a Company has provided authorization for a transfer to Contractor, Company will not be able to cancel the electronic transfer. NowLanguage may review certain potentially high-risk transactions. If a payment is subject to such payment review, NowLanguage will place a hold on the payment and provide notice to the Company and Contractor, as applicable, either through their NowLanguage account or by electronic mail. NowLanguage will conduct a review and either clear or cancel the payment. If the payment is cleared, NowLanguage will provide notice to the Company and Contractor, as applicable. Otherwise, NowLanguage will cancel the payment and the funds will be returned to the Company.<br>
<br>
<em data-new-link="true">Payment Terms
</em><br><br>
Contractors receive payment promptly following assessment of sufficient funds and typically within seven business days of Company transmitting such funds through the NowLanguage Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, NowLanguage provides no guarantee for such a payment timeline and may hold funds for up to 180 days if reasonably necessary to protect against the risk of liability or if you have violated these T&amp;C. Payments to Contractors are dependent upon Companies processing funds through the NowLanguage Service. NowLanguage agrees that it shall only be liable to Contractors to the extent that funds from Companies have been processed through the NowLanguage Service.&nbsp; NowLanguage does not guarantee payments to Contractors for amounts that have not been successfully received from Companies.<br><br>
